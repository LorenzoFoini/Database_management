# Enterprise ICT Architectures - Dataset Project
![](image_readme.jpg)
This repository contains the project developed for the **Enterprise ICT Architectures** course. The project involves defining and querying datasets created by our team using various relational and non-relational database technologies.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into three sub-projects, each dedicated to a specific technology:

1. **SQL** - Implementation of relational databases and SQL queries.
2. **Neo4J and BPMN** - Data modeling with Neo4J (graph databases) and using BPMN notation for a given business process.
3. **MongoDB** - Use of NoSQL databases for managing and querying semi-structured data.

Each sub-project contains its own **README.md** with specific details on implementation, datasets, and queries used.

## Technologies Used
During the development of this project, we utilized:
- **SQL** for relational databases
- **Neo4J** for graph databases
- **MongoDB** for NoSQL databases
- **BPMN** for process modeling
- **Python** and **ChatGPT** for assisted data generation, ensuring compliance with assigned constraints

## Project Setup
To run the various sub-projects, follow the instructions provided in their respective README.md files.
